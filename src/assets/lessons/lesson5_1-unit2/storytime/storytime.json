Vinay painted the other side of  the gate.<br>\"The paint fell on the ground.<br>The paint fell on the wall.<br>The paint fell on them.\"<br>At last they finished. They wiped off the paint that had splashed on the ground. <br>They wiped off the paint that had splashed on the wall.<br>They wiped off the paint that had splashed on them.<br>\"I love my red gate!\" said Veena.<br>\"I love my green gate!\" said Vinay.<br>\"Oh, you have made a two-coloured gate!\"cried the painter.<br>\"Let us keep it that way!\"\" said Mother.\"</pre>"
