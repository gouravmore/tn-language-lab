What if the tiger roars? <br>Should I just go back to sleep? But I am not sleepy any more. <br>Then someone turns on the light. Ma is standing at the door.<br>What happened, dear? Did you call me? asks Ma. <br>I point towards the tiger. Ma bends and pulls the tiger out from under the bed! <br>Hey, this is no tiger. This is my thick yellow and black sweater. Its buttons shine like a tiger's eyes. <br>I got scared for nothing! Ma gets me some water. <br>Now I will sleep. And dream about real tigers in a jungle!</pre>"
