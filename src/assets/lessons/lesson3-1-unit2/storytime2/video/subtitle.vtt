00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:16.187
<b>When Rohan woke up, he began to
playing with Jimmy, his dog.</b>

2
00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:24.030
<b>There’s something you should do first!
said his big sister, Riya.</b>

3
00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.679
<b>BRUSH YOUR TEETH!</b>

4
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:34.225
<b>I don’t want to brush my teeth!
Jimmy doesn’t brush his teeth!</b>

5
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.030
<b>Animals take care of their
teeth too, but in other ways!</b>

6
00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:44.959
<b>We must brush our teeth
to keep germs away!</b>

7
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:46.874
<b>Germs?</b>

8
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:52.859
<b>Germs are very tiny creatures
that you cannot see.</b>

9
00:00:53.422 --> 00:00:58.968
<b>If you don’t brush properly, they
stay in your mouth and hurt you!</b>

10
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.116
<b>Ouch!</b>

11
00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:06.700
<b>YES! That’s why we must
take good care of our teeth</b>

12
00:01:06.773 --> 00:01:11.047
<b>by brushing twice a day
- morning and night!</b>

13
00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:14.054
<b>But brushing is no fun!</b>

14
00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:19.335
<b>I’ll tell you a secret, Rohan!
Rohan smiled.</b>

15
00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:24.031
<b>Mummy called out,
It’s breakfast time!</b>

16
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:28.405
<b>There’s something we should do first!
said Riya.</b>

17
00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:30.530
<b>WASH OUR HANDS!</b>

18
00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:35.874
<b>But Jimmy never
washes his hands!</b>

19
00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:43.156
<b>Riya laughed, He doesn’t use his
hands or paws to eat like we do!</b>

20
00:01:43.368 --> 00:01:47.899
<b>We must wash our hands with
soap to get rid of germs.</b>

21
00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:53.773
<b>Are germs on our hands too?
Germs are EVERYWHERE!</b>

22
00:01:54.757 --> 00:02:00.617
<b>Aaaah-chhhooo! Riya covered her mouth
with her hands as she sneezed.</b>

23
00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:11.273
<b>Don't do that! My teacher says that we should
sneeze into our sleeve, not our hands! said Rohan.</b>

24
00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:12.702
<b>Why?</b>

25
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:18.763
<b>Because when we sneeze into our
hands, germs stick to them.</b>

26
00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:22.708
<b>we spread germs and
make others sick!</b>

27
00:02:24.138 --> 00:02:31.373
<b>Here comes Germy! Riya shouted, chasing
Rohan and waving her dirty hands.</b>

28
00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:32.599
<b>EEEEEEEK!</b>

29
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:38.177
<b>Later Riya showed Rohan the
proper way to wash hands.</b>

30
00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:41.599
<b>Wet your hands and
turn off the tap.</b>

31
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.257
<b>Then rub in some soap on the palms, the
back of the hands and between the fingers.</b>

32
00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:52.296
<b>Scrub hands for twenty seconds!</b>

33
00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:58.669
<b>Now, it’s time to
rinse off and dry!</b>

34
00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:05.278
<b>But that’s a long time! Remember
my secret? Rohan smiled.</b>

35
00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:11.747
<b>When they came back home after
playing, Riya nudged Rohan,</b>

36
00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.920
<b>There’s something
we should do first!</b>

37
00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:20.381
<b>Mummy teased, Play some more?
TAKE A BATH!</b>

38
00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:24.982
<b>Mummy, don’t you know that
germs are everywhere?</b>

39
00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:30.013
<b>We can’t see them, but they
stick to our skin and clothes!</b>

40
00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:36.281
<b>That’s why we must bathe every
day… …to get rid of them!</b>

41
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:40.374
<b>Start by getting yourself
wet, said Mummy.</b>

42
00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:43.443
<b>Then apply soap all over!</b>

43
00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:50.786
<b>Riya and Rohan giggled as Mummy’s
ticklish fingers soaped them up.</b>

44
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.859
<b>Then it’s time to rinse off!
And dry with a clean towel!</b>

45
00:03:57.357 --> 00:03:58.724
<b>SUPERCLEAN!</b>

46
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.083
<b>It’s Jimmy’s turn next!</b>

47
00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:04.678
<b>Do you want to listen to a story?
asked Papa.</b>

48
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:10.083
<b>There’s something we should do first!
reminded Riya. Tidy UP!</b>

49
00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.984
<b>Rohan yawned. Do we have to?</b>

50
00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:19.700
<b>Remember you couldn’t find
your ball the other day?</b>

51
00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:26.061
<b>Putting things away in the proper place
makes it easy to find them later!</b>

52
00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:28.700
<b>And keeps our house neat!</b>

53
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:35.302
<b>You both are so smart! said
Papa proudly. Bedtime!</b>

54
00:04:35.802 --> 00:04:41.872
<b>Papa! There’s something we should do first!
said Riya, pulling Rohan along.</b>

55
00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:48.787
<b>Make the germs disappear with
our magic secret! Rohan nodded.</b>

56
00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:54.146
<b>A few minutes later, Mummy and
Papa heard a familiar tune.</b>

57
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.372
<b>So that’s your secret! said Papa.
Humming a song to make brushing fun!</b>

58
00:05:01.864 --> 00:05:04.528
<b>And while washing our hands too!</b>

59
00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:10.482
<b>That’s a great idea! said Mummy.</b>

60
00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:16.162
<b>Rohan and Riya enjoy taking
care of themselves. Do you?</b>

61
00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.059
<b>They make up a game with the
germs and guess who wins?</b>

62
00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:25.567
<b>Germs say, yucky, mucky and dirty is FUN!</b>

63
00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:29.653
<b>I say, I brush and wash
and I know I have won!</b>

64
00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.067
<b>Germs say, never bathe,
it’s a waste of time!</b>

65
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.412
<b>I say, smelling nice
with soap is so fine.</b>

66
00:05:38.874 --> 00:05:42.420
<b>Naughty germ says don’t
pick up your things,</b>

67
00:05:42.684 --> 00:05:44.684
<b>The house looks better that way.</b>

68
00:05:45.075 --> 00:05:48.732
<b>I say, I tidy up because
I like my things</b>

69
00:05:49.122 --> 00:05:51.388
<b>That is a good way
to end my day!</b>

70
00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:57.020
<b>I feel better in every way
I FEEL BETTER IN EVERY WAY!!!!!</b>

71
00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:03.380
<b>Now make up your secret song and hum
it when you have to do boring things!</b>
