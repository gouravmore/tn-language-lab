00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:16.077
<b>Meera, I went to your school today!
Amma said one day.</b>

2
00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.515
<b>Really? Meera said.</b>

3
00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:21.757
<b>And the gate was wide open,</b>

4
00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.468
<b>and the watchman was missing!</b>

5
00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:33.476
<b>Oh! He was in our classroom, to
see why our teacher had screamed!</b>

6
00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:40.265
<b>And why did your teacher scream?
Amma asked.</b>

7
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.984
<b>Because Rohan began crying!</b>

8
00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:51.726
<b>And why did Rohan cry?
Amma wanted to know.</b>

9
00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:56.313
<b>Because the snake he had
brought back from the zoo</b>

10
00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:08.468
<b>had eaten his mouse! And then the teacher
screamed and the watchman came running!</b>

11
00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:21.594
<b>But I went to your classroom, and
there was nobody there! said Amma.</b>

12
00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:28.719
<b>We were all hiding in the
Staff Room, Meera said.</b>

13
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:33.602
<b>Because Rohan’s snake
was in our classroom!</b>

14
00:01:37.157 --> 00:01:43.953
<b>But Meera, when I went to the Staff
Room, I didn’t see anyone there!</b>

15
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.149
<b>That is because we had all run away
to the Principal’s Room, Meera said.</b>

16
00:01:52.648 --> 00:01:57.500
<b>Because Rohan said the
snake was following us!</b>

17
00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:05.336
<b>But when I went to the Principal’s
Room, it was empty! Amma said.</b>

18
00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:08.728
<b>We couldn’t stay
there, Meera said,</b>

19
00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:12.844
<b>because Rohan’s snake
was looking for him.</b>

20
00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:18.618
<b>We climbed up to the terrace and
stayed there till the bell rang!</b>

21
00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:27.978
<b>And I waited and waited in your
school, all alone! Amma said.</b>

22
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:34.789
<b>Not all alone, Amma, you
had the snake for company!</b>

23
00:02:35.295 --> 00:02:41.076
<b>The snake! Amma said, sitting
down with a thump on a chair.</b>
