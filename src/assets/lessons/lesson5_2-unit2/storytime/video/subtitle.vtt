<b>The last living thing on Earth was
a magician who lost his magic!</b>

2
00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:27.054
<b>Bluie tried different tricks but
with no luck- his life was tragic.</b>

3
00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:35.179
<b>He thought of olden days when
the Earth was cool and blue,</b>

4
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:40.898
<b>It shrank and all living things
vanished without a clue.</b>

5
00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:51.406
<b>I need to go too but how, and where to?...
thought Bluie.</b>

6
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:56.679
<b>Without magic, he
felt hot and gooey.</b>

7
00:00:57.117 --> 00:01:01.062
<b>Lonely Bluie craved
to go for a swim...</b>

8
00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:09.367
<b>As days went by- a time
traveler scientist spotted him!</b>

9
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:18.148
<b>Bluie was surprised to
see someone suddenly!</b>

10
00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:24.539
<b>Moli the scientist was
really nice and friendly.</b>

11
00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:32.203
<b>Both were happy to find a new
friend from past and present,</b>

12
00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:36.554
<b>They made plans to stay
together till the end.</b>

13
00:01:37.218 --> 00:01:42.492
<b>Moli took Bluie in her faster than
the speed of light- time machine,</b>

14
00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:51.921
<b>They time traveled to the past
when the Earth was big and green!</b>

15
00:01:57.022 --> 00:02:02.921
<b>Life in the olden times
looked really nice and cool,</b>

16
00:02:03.343 --> 00:02:07.007
<b>Bluie wished to quickly
jump into the pool!</b>

17
00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:15.929
<b>The lush green Earth had
valleys of colourful flowers,</b>

18
00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:23.195
<b>Full of many living things,
enjoying life for hours.</b>

19
00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:27.906
<b>Bluie ran with joy to say
hello to the past world,</b>

20
00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:34.281
<b>Where there was still hope
and plenty of colours!</b>

21
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.367
<b>Moli told everyone that
Bluie came from the future,</b>

22
00:02:40.718 --> 00:02:45.351
<b>At the time when planet Earth
turned red without nurture.</b>

23
00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.867
<b>Bluie celebrated the beauty
of the past time gone,</b>

24
00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:54.132
<b>He made new friends
and was not alone!</b>
