Ramya loved earrings.<br>Everybody, who gave her gifts, gave her earrings. She had red earrings, blue earrings, green earrings, and earrings of all the colours in the rainbow.<br>Then for Ramya's birthday, do you know what her Grandma got her?\"<br>\"Grandma got Ramya really pretty diamond earrings that looked like stars!<br>Ramya loved them. <br>\"Oh! Grandma, from where did you get such pretty diamond stars?\"\" she asked.\"<br>\"It was a starless night, and Grandpa pointed to the skies.<br>\"See, there are no stars in the sky any longer. I plucked all the stars from the sky and chose the best ones for your earrings,\"\" Grandma replied.\"<br>\"This made Ramya very sad.<br>\"\"Twinkle, twinkle little star,<br>How I wonder where you are?<br>Up above the world so high,<br>Please come back like diamonds in the sky!\"\" Ramya sang unhappily.\"<br>\"That night, Ramya took off her earrings and put them carefully under her pillow. <br>She hoped a fairy would return the stars to the sky<br>In the middle of the night, Ramya had a beautiful dream.\"<br>\"In the dream, a fairy came and told Ramya, \"\"Don't worry Ramya, I have thousands of new stars for the sky!\"\"<br>Ramya woke up, and do you know what she saw?\"<br>The night sky was filled with stars.<br>Ramya's eyes sparkled as she put on her precious diamond star earrings again.<br>Now, Ramya is so happy!</pre>"
