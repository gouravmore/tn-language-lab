<b>Once upon a time there was a
little girl called Ramya.</b>

2
00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:19.210
<b>Ramya loved earrings.</b>

3
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:24.609
<b>Everybody who gave her
gifts, gave her earrings.</b>

4
00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:31.676
<b>She had red earrings, blue
earrings, green earrings,</b>

5
00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:36.474
<b>and earrings of all the
colours in the rainbow.</b>

6
00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:39.723
<b>Then, for Ramya's birthday,</b>

7
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.481
<b>do you know what her
Grandma got her?</b>

8
00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:51.035
<b>Grandma got Ramya really pretty diamond
earrings that looked like stars!</b>

9
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:53.746
<b>Ramya loved them.</b>

10
00:00:54.355 --> 00:01:00.785
<b>Oh! Grandma, from where did you
get such pretty diamond stars?</b>

11
00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:02.207
<b>she asked.</b>

12
00:01:02.754 --> 00:01:08.450
<b>It was a starless night,
and Grandma pointed to the sky.</b>

13
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:13.918
<b>See, there are no stars
in the sky any longer.</b>

14
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.988
<b>I plucked all the
stars from the sky</b>

15
00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:24.277
<b>and chose the best ones for
your earrings, Grandma replied.</b>

16
00:01:24.527 --> 00:01:27.168
<b>This made Ramya very sad.</b>

17
00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:33.574
<b>Twinkle, twinkle little star,</b>

18
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.996
<b>How I wonder where you are?</b>

19
00:01:37.637 --> 00:01:40.410
<b>Up above the world so high,</b>

20
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.472
<b>Please come back like
diamonds in the sky!</b>

21
00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:48.433
<b>Ramya sang unhappily.</b>

22
00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:55.965
<b>That night, Ramya took off her earrings and
put them carefully under her pillow.</b>

23
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.019
<b>She hoped a fairy would
return the stars to the sky.</b>

24
00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:06.769
<b>In the middle of the night,
Ramya had a beautiful dream.</b>

25
00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:12.105
<b>In the dream, a fairy
came and told Ramya,</b>

26
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.394
<b>Don’t worry Ramya, I have thousands
of new stars for the sky!</b>

27
00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:24.332
<b>Ramya woke up, and do
you know what she saw?</b>

28
00:02:24.864 --> 00:02:28.410
<b>The night sky was
filled with stars!</b>

29
00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:39.277
<b>Ramya's eyes sparkled as she put on her
precious diamond star earrings again!</b>

30
00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:43.762
<b>Now, Ramya is so happy!</b>
